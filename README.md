# todoList-with-webpack

## Project Description
 > "To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. You will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and you will do it using ES6 and Webpack!


## Things done so far:

### 1. Create list structure

- Use custom-built Webpack boilerplate
- Implement app structure using classes
- Populate to-do list dynamically on page load
- Implement event listener using promise
- Configure repository to deploy from Webpack output directory

### 2. Make list interactive

- Track task status
- Implement Web Storage API for local storage of tasks


### 3. Adding Functionalites

- I remove all hardcoded items from the tasks `array`.
- I created a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- Implemented a function for adding a new task `(add a new element to the array)`.
- Implemented a function for editing task descriptions.
- Implemented a function for deleting a task `(remove an element from the array)`.
- Implemented a function for the "Clear all completed" button `(use filter() method)`.
- By default new tasks have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new` array length`.
- Deleting a task updates all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique.
- All changes to the To Do List are saved in `local storage`.

## Built With

- Major languages: HTML, CSS, JS
